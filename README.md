# slackbot-lastfm

This bot will get from last fm what you are scrobling at the moment.

This code is far from optimized as it was made on a run just for a test.

Commands: 
.set <lastfm username>
.np

.np will make the bot tell the channel what you are currently listening (scrobling on lastfm)

Follow this guide to create the slackbot on slack, you will need the ID
