# slackbot-lastfm

## What is it?
Originaly, this bot was getting from last fm what a user was scrobling at the moment.
Then it got a bit further and we added this feature and maybe in the future we will add that feature.

This code is far from optimized as it was made on a run just for a test.

## Commands: 
.set <lastfm username>
.np
.random 

* set \<lastfm username\>
* np
  will make the bot tell the channel what you are currently listening (scrobling on lastfm)
* random
  will make the bot tell the channel a random (metal) band
